# Master-s-Projects

Here you can find some projects authored and co-authored by me during my Master's in Development Economics and Statistics in the University of Bordeaux. My Master's thesis on "Post-Keynesian Sustainable Development" and internship report on the OECD EAMFP Indicator are also available in the `Essays and Reports` directory. Keep in mind that for these projects the main software used was STATA, however upon demand I can send codes for other projects on VBA, SQL and R. Since, I obtain my Master's in France, some documents are only available in French. 

Structure by project: 
 - All data files go in the `data` directory.
 - All do files go in the `dofiles` directory.
 - All other documents (reports, presentations, etc.) go in the `documentation` directory.
