# Master-s-Projects
# Here you can find some projects authored and co-authored during my Master's in Development Economics and Statistics. My Master's thesis on "Post-Keynesian Sustainable Development" and internship report on the OECD EAMFP Indicator are also available. Keep in mind that for these projects the main software used was STATA, however upon demand I can send codes for other projects on VBA, SQL and R. Since, I obtain my Master's in France, some documents are only available in French.
